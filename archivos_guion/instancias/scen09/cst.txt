Objective :If there is a solution find that one which uses the minimal number
of assigned values.
If there is no solution minimize the cost function with the following 
coefficients :

             a1 = 1000
             a2 =  100
             a3 =   10
             a4 =    1
             b1 = 1000
             b2 =  100
             b3 =   10
             b4 =    1
