Objective: If there are several solutions find that one which minimizes the
number of assigned values.
If there is no solution minimize the cost function with the following 
coefficients :

             a1 =   1000
             a2 =    100
             a3 =      2
             a4 =      1
             b1 = 100000
             b2 =  10000
             b3 =    100
             b4 =     10
